# Baby-Programming-Language

The final project for the Bridgewater State University class, COMP 340 - Organization of Programming Languages. We had to create a decipher, lexer, parser and evaluator for an interpreter which makes user input baby language code instead of an arithmetic expression. The baby expression includes baby words, and the words correspond to specific characters.

The baby expression includes baby words, and the words correspond to specific characters. 
The
relationship between baby words and characters is shown below.

# Baby Word  -> Character
# pee -> +
# gah -> -
# milk -> *
# heh -> /
# mama -> (
# dada -> )
# b -> 0
# ba -> 1
# baa -> 2
# baaa -> 3
# baaaa -> 4
# baaaaa -> 5
# baaaaaa -> 6
# baaaaaaa -> 7
# baaaaaaaa -> 8
# baaaaaaaaa -> 9

In a baby expression, when digit-baby words have white spaces between them such as “baa ba” and
“baaa ba baaa”, they will correspond to a single number with multiple digits like “31” and “313".
